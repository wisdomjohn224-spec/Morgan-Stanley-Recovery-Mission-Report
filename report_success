--- Morgan Stanley Recovery Mission Report ---
Our mission was to uncover financial discrepancies and potential revenue leaks within Morgan Stanley's cross-border settlements.

### The Ghosts We Found: ###

Ghost 1: The Missing Capital
This ghost represents transactions that Morgan Stanley's internal ledger marked as 'SUCCESS' but were completely absent from the bank statement. These are transactions for which the company never received payment.
  - Number of Missing Transactions: 18
  - Total Dollar Value Lost (Ghost 1): $51647.50

Ghost 2: The Status Liars
This ghost identifies transactions where our internal system recorded 'SUCCESS', but the bank reported 'FAILED'. This is critical as customers may have received services without Morgan Stanley getting paid.
  - Number of Status Mismatch Transactions: 17
  - Total Dollar Value Lost (Ghost 2): $49174.16

Ghost 3: The Rounding Leak
This subtle ghost involves tiny, but cumulatively significant, $0.01 discrepancies between internal and bank transaction amounts. If left unchecked, these can lead to substantial losses over time.
  - Number of Rounding Leak Transactions: 49
  - Total Dollar Value Lost (Ghost 3): $0.49

Time-Lag Analysis:
We also analyzed the time differences between internal and bank timestamps to understand the operational latency.
  - Average Latency between internal and bank logs: 0.00 seconds

--- Final Deliverables ---
Total Revenue at Risk: $100822.15
Total Number of Ghosts: 3
Remediation Strategy: Implement real-time reconciliation processes and automated alerts for status and amount discrepancies to prevent future revenue loss.
